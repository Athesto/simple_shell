One of the most important features

## 
ls is an alias
/bin/ls is the program
-l is an argument
there is a shell
you can find the manual `man ls`


## TASK
Write a blog post describing step by step what happens when you type ls -l and hit Enter in a shell. Try to explain every step you know of, going in as much details as you can, give examples and draw diagrams when needed. You should merge your previous knowledge of the shell with the specifics of how it works under the hoods (including syscalls).
