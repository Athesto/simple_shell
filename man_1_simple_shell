.SH DESCRIPTION
The basic shell reads its standard input from your terminal, and sends its standard output and standard error back to your terminal unless you tell it to send them elsewhere. Is line oriented; it does not process your commands until you press Enter to indicate the end of a line.

The shell splits the line into tokens. A token is a command, variable, or other symbol recognized by the shell. It continues to build up a sequence of tokens until it comes to a reserved word function name, or operator
